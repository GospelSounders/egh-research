          "description": "The amazing story of the early Christian believers is told in Volume 4, The Acts of the Apostles. After Jesus was victorious over Satan and returned to heaven, the enemy turned his attention to Jesus' church on earth. Here are thrilling stories of fierce persecutions and unswerving loyalty to God. Peter, Paul, James, John, Luke, Barnabas, Stephen, Mark, and the other early apostles carried the wonderful news of the gospel to all of the then-known world. Unwilling to surrender their faith, many gave their lives. That story is still continuing. Christ's church today is carrying forward the same work and has the same promise of divine guidance and power.<br/><b>NOTE: Pagination follows that of the standard printing which is also used in the Comprehensive (Topical) Index to the Writings of Ellen G. White.</b>",

          "description": "Volume 5 of the Conflict of the Ages series carries the story of the controversy between God and Satan to its ultimate and glorious conclusion. Beginning with the destruction of Jerusalem and continuing through the persecutions of Christians in the Roman Empire, the apostasy of the Dark Ages, the shining light of the Reformation, and the worldwide religious awakening of the nineteenth century, this volume traces the conflict into the future, to the Second Coming of Jesus and the glories of the earth made new. As the end draws ever closer, the vital issue of loyalty to God will become decisive. In this concluding volume, the author powerfully points out the principles involved in the impending conflict and how each person can stand firmly for God and His truth.<br/><b>NOTE: Pagination follows that of the standard printing which is also used in the Comprehensive (Topical) Index to the Writings of Ellen G. White.</b>",

Headlines describe famine, wars, unemployment, pollution, and disease. The media can tell you what is happening, but this book reveals why. The Great Hope also tells you what will happen next. This glimpse into the future is based on a source that has never failed in its prophecies—the Bible. The conflict between good and evil is coming to a dramatic climax that will affect every family on the planet. But take hope. You can choose to be on the winning side.",

When she came out of vision, this world seemed dark and lonely compared with the brilliant beauty of the world to come which she had seen so vividly. And she often struggled to find the words to describe what she had been shown in vision.<br/>This compilation gathers the choicest statements and descriptions she has given over the years about heaven—the future home of the redeemed. Here you will find not only descriptions of the glories that await, but insights into the activities of the redeemed, the certainty of Jesus’ coming to take us home, the end of evil, and how heaven can begin in our lives even now.

With unusual insights the author describes the role of our planet in the cosmic conflict between right and wrong,  truth and error. She describes the tragic rebellion that took place in heaven many thousands of years ago and makes plain  that this ongoing conflict between Satan and God affects each person who lives on Earth. <em>Patriarchs and Prophets</em> shows  how this conflict worked itself out in the lives of men and women in Old Testament times. It answers such questions  as: “Where did we come from?” “Where are we going?” and “If God is all-powerful, why doesn’t He prevent the  spread of evil and its tragic results?”",

Beginning with Lucifer’s rebellion in heaven and continuing to the work of angels after the end of sin, this volume provides a behind-the-scenes view of the existence and activities of angels as they go about the work of heaven. Best of all, it will help you enjoy the fellowship of angels in your daily walk with God.",

          "description": "Between the summers of 1971 and 1972, Pastor Dores A. Delafield and his wife, Evelyn, conducted seminar-type meetings with ministers, teachers, and laymen throughout Western and Eastern Europe. Often their journeys took them to towns and cities where Ellen White lived and labored between the years 1885 and 1887. <em>Ellen G. White in Europe</em> is the first serious attempt ever to put into print the record of those eventful years when Mrs. White labored so tirelessly on the European continent. Her influence was felt in the evangelistic and institutional expansion of Seventh-day Adventist witnessing in eight European countries. As a preacher and counselor she participated in  important conference sessions. She lectured in the major Adventist churches in Europe, meanwhile carrying forward a vast literary work, the influence of which is still felt around the world. Mrs. White appears in this volume not simply as a Christian laborer on the European scene, but as the Lord's special messenger, a warm, friendly human being yet conscientious and faithful in bearing her strong and inspired testimony for the Lord. The book opens an entirely new chapter in her lifework little known to the world and to the vast majority of Seventh-day Adventists. Her diary accounts of her European travels have been drawn from heavily as source material.",

To open a window of understanding to Ellen White’s heart, readers need to know and even experience her passions. There are two braided golden threads that weave through her entire life and experience that are central to who she was and what she accomplished—the love of God in Christ and a focus on Scripture. Her orientation toward the love of God and the Bible were integrally interwoven with her prophetic ministry. Her writings, which were guided by prophetic revelation through visions and prophetic dreams, must be read and understood with this perspective. ",

Therefore, for example, many passages are written in present tense where traditional versions would be past tense. Originally published in 1862, the most recent revision was made in 1898, after Young's death.",

Após ser vencido por Cristo na cruz, Satanás, com grande ira, voltou sua atenção à igreja de Cristo na terra. Nesse livro você encontrará muitas emocionantes histórias de cruéis perseguições e da inabalável lealdade dos fiéis de Deus. Pedro, Paulo, Tiago, João, Lucas, Barnabé, Estevão, Marcos, e os outros apóstolos proclamaram as preciosas novas do Evangelho a todo o mundo então conhecido. Resolutos em não renunciar sua fé, muitos perderam sua vida. Mas a história ainda continua. A igreja de Cristo hoje está promovendo a mesma obra daquela época e ela têm a mesma promessa de direção e poder divinos de então.",

На нашем пути Бог насаждает цветы обетований, чтобы украсить ими нашу жизнь. Он устроил дорогу к небесам такой приятной. Когда мы изучаем Божьи обетования, то находим в них утешение, надежду и радость, потому что они являются Словами Безграничного”.</br>В этой книге собраны слова обетования и утешения для людей любого возраста и жизненной ситуации. Данные обетования, поддерживающие жизнь, особенно важны в эти последние дни земной истории, когда с большей силой разгорается великая борьба. Когда уже не на что опереться, мы все еще можем ухватиться за шнурки веры и найти убежище в заверении Божьего неизменного слова. ",

Будем помнить, что христоподобная жизнь служит самым убедительным свидетельством в пользу христианства, а профанация христианами своего призвания делает больше вреда, чем жизнь мирских людей. Не все книги могут послужить той же цели, которую в силах достичь благочестивая жизнь христиан. Люди поверят не тому, что проповедуется служителями церкви, а тому, какую жизнь ведут ее члены”.</br>Эта книга в основном является выдержкой из 9-го тома “Свидетельств для церкви”, и очень практически показывает нам, что такое христоподобная жизнь.

After Jesus was victorious over Satan and returned to heaven, the enemy turned his attention to Jesus' church on earth. Here are thrilling stories of fierce persecutions and unswerving loyalty to God. Peter, Paul, James, John, Luke, Barnabas, Stephen, Mark, and the other early apostles carried the wonderful news of the gospel to all of the then-known world. Unwilling to surrender their faith, many gave their lives. That story is still continuing. Christ's church today is carrying forward the same work and has the same promise of divine guidance and power.<br/><b>NOTE: Pagination follows that of the standard printing which is also used in the Comprehensive (Topical) Index to the Writings of Ellen G.

Christ Himself “went about doing good, healing all who were oppressed by the devil.” His healing was not only physical, but spiritual as well.<br/>This exceptional book by Ellen White is a call to—the church and to individuals—help others with medical and spiritual needs. When we follow this counsel, we are heeding the advice of Isaiah 58, which outlines our responsibility to help those who are sick and needy. This is the true service that God wants from us, and that is so powerfully called for in this timeless book.",

No one else has had such a profound influence on Planet Earth as Jesus Christ. In this book the author does not set forth the events of Jesus’ life in strict chronological order, but she presents Him as the One who can satisfy the deepest yearnings of the human heart. She presents the divine beauty of the life of the Savior, the love of God as revealed in His Son. New and glorious light flashes from many familiar passages of Scripture. Follow Jesus in these pages from His birth in Bethlehem’s stable to His death on the cross, His glorious resurrection, and triumphant return to heaven.<br/><b>NOTE: Pagination follows that of the standard printing which is also used in the Comprehensive (Topical) Index to the Writings of Ellen G.

          "description": "Some of Ellen White’s earliest visions contained bright glimpses of heaven and the earth made new. When she came out of vision, this world seemed dark and lonely compared with the brilliant beauty of the world to come which she had seen so vividly. And she often struggled to find the words to describe what she had been shown in vision.<br/>This compilation gathers the choicest statements and descriptions she has given over the years about heaven—the future home of the redeemed. Here you will find not only descriptions of the glories that await, but insights into the activities of the redeemed, the certainty of Jesus’ coming to take us home, the end of evil, and how heaven can begin in our lives even now. This book will make you homesick for a home you haven’t been to—yet.",

Scripture declares that God's people will be victorious “by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.” In their every act, word, and thought, they will express their faith and assurance that “God is Love.”",

          "description": "<em>Patriarchs and Prophets</em> is the first volume in the Conflict of the Ages series.  It covers the sweeping panorama of human history from the creation of Earth to the reign of Israel's King David.  With unusual insights the author describes the role of our planet in the cosmic conflict between right and wrong,  truth and error. She describes the tragic rebellion that took place in heaven many thousands of years ago and makes plain  that this ongoing conflict between Satan and God affects each person who lives on Earth. <em>Patriarchs and Prophets</em> shows  how this conflict worked itself out in the lives of men and women in Old Testament times. It answers such questions  as: “Where did we come from?” “Where are we going?” and “If God is all-powerful, why doesn’t He prevent the  spread of evil and its tragic results?”",

In these pages can vividly be seen dramatic evidences of the raging struggle between God and Satan for the hearts of men and women. Here the reader will find fascinating characters—wise Solomon, fearless Elijah, wicked Ahaz, beloved Daniel, courageous Jeremiah, and many others. Their experiences provide rich lessons of faith and evidences of God’s love and providential care.<br/><b>NOTE: Pagination follows that of the standard printing which is also used in the Comprehensive (Topical) Index to the Writings of Ellen G.

Although society has changed markedly since Mrs. White lived and wrote, the principles she stressed regarding temperance remain remarkably relevant to contemporary life. The power of alcohol and other forms of intemperance to destroy health, moral fiber, and spiritual discernment is still present today.

Beginning with Lucifer’s rebellion in heaven and continuing to the work of angels after the end of sin, this volume provides a behind-the-scenes view of the existence and activities of angels as they go about the work of heaven. Best of all, it will help you enjoy the fellowship of angels in your daily walk with God.",

The soul that turns to God for its help, its support, its power, by daily, earnest prayer, will have noble aspirations, clear perceptions of truth and duty, lofty purposes of action, and a continual hungering and thirsting after righteousness. By maintaining a connection with God, we shall be enabled to diffuse to others, through our association with them, the light, the peace, the serenity, that rule in our hearts” (p. 290).<br/>May you find the serenity that comes from knowing the One whose Spirit inspired these pages.",

          "description": "Between the summers of 1971 and 1972, Pastor Dores A. Delafield and his wife, Evelyn, conducted seminar-type meetings with ministers, teachers, and laymen throughout Western and Eastern Europe. Often their journeys took them to towns and cities where Ellen White lived and labored between the years 1885 and 1887. <em>Ellen G. White in Europe</em> is the first serious attempt ever to put into print the record of those eventful years when Mrs. White labored so tirelessly on the European continent. Her influence was felt in the evangelistic and institutional expansion of Seventh-day Adventist witnessing in eight European countries. As a preacher and counselor she participated in  important conference sessions. She lectured in the major Adventist churches in Europe, meanwhile carrying forward a vast literary work, the influence of which is still felt around the world. Mrs. White appears in this volume not simply as a Christian laborer on the European scene, but as the Lord's special messenger, a warm, friendly human being yet conscientious and faithful in bearing her strong and inspired testimony for the Lord. The book opens an entirely new chapter in her lifework little known to the world and to the vast majority of Seventh-day Adventists. Her diary accounts of her European travels have been drawn from heavily as source material.",

Thus the writers respectively address such subjects as eating and drinking habits, travel conditions, and entertainment, among other things in society.",

To open a window of understanding to Ellen White’s heart, readers need to know and even experience her passions. There are two braided golden threads that weave through her entire life and experience that are central to who she was and what she accomplished—the love of God in Christ and a focus on Scripture. Her orientation toward the love of God and the Bible were integrally interwoven with her prophetic ministry. Her writings, which were guided by prophetic revelation through visions and prophetic dreams, must be read and understood with this perspective. ",

          "description": "A fascinante história dos primeiros cristãos é apresentada no volume 4 da série “O Conflito dos Séculos”, intitulado “Atos dos Apóstolos”. Após ser vencido por Cristo na cruz, Satanás, com grande ira, voltou sua atenção à igreja de Cristo na terra. Nesse livro você encontrará muitas emocionantes histórias de cruéis perseguições e da inabalável lealdade dos fiéis de Deus. Pedro, Paulo, Tiago, João, Lucas, Barnabé, Estevão, Marcos, e os outros apóstolos proclamaram as preciosas novas do Evangelho a todo o mundo então conhecido. Resolutos em não renunciar sua fé, muitos perderam sua vida. Mas a história ainda continua. A igreja de Cristo hoje está promovendo a mesma obra daquela época e ela têm a mesma promessa de direção e poder divinos de então.",

На нашем пути Бог насаждает цветы обетований, чтобы украсить ими нашу жизнь. Он устроил дорогу к небесам такой приятной. Когда мы изучаем Божьи обетования, то находим в них утешение, надежду и радость, потому что они являются Словами Безграничного”.</br>В этой книге собраны слова обетования и утешения для людей любого возраста и жизненной ситуации. Данные обетования, поддерживающие жизнь, особенно важны в эти последние дни земной истории, когда с большей силой разгорается великая борьба. Когда уже не на что опереться, мы все еще можем ухватиться за шнурки веры и найти убежище в заверении Божьего неизменного слова. ",

Не все книги могут послужить той же цели, которую в силах достичь благочестивая жизнь христиан. Люди поверят не тому, что проповедуется служителями церкви, а тому, какую жизнь ведут ее члены”.</br>Эта книга в основном является выдержкой из 9-го тома “Свидетельств для церкви”, и очень практически показывает нам, что такое христоподобная жизнь.

After Jesus was victorious over Satan and returned to heaven, the enemy turned his attention to Jesus' church on earth. Here are thrilling stories of fierce persecutions and unswerving loyalty to God. Peter, Paul, James, John, Luke, Barnabas, Stephen, Mark, and the other early apostles carried the wonderful news of the gospel to all of the then-known world. Unwilling to surrender their faith, many gave their lives. That story is still continuing. Christ's church today is carrying forward the same work and has the same promise of divine guidance and power.<br/><b>NOTE: Pagination follows that of the standard printing which is also used in the Comprehensive (Topical) Index to the Writings of Ellen G.

The autobiographical section of the book describes the author’s conversion experience, the Millerite movement of 1840-1844, and the early visions that formed the foundation of her theology and ministry. A second section contains counsel on various matters pertaining the experience of the early Adventist believers.<br/>The final half of the book traces salvation history from the fall of Satan in heaven to the final end of sin and sinners. This material forms the core of the later five-volume Conflict of the Ages Series.<br/>Ellen White’s bold apocalyptic imagery helped to shape a movement centered on the hope of the Second Coming. This volume bears witness that God continues to reveal Himself through dreams and visions to chosen individuals today.",

        "description": "This classic work on education sets forth the unique and challenging idea that “the work of education and the work of redemption are one.” The ultimate goal of all learning should be to understand more about our Creator-Redeemer and to reflect that understanding in our personal lives. In her writings on this subject, Ellen White was concerned, not with details of curriculum or educational systems, but with great, guiding principles. The result is a penetrating look at the factors that make up true education in its broadest sense. The reader will find in these pages insights to guide not only parents, students, and teachers, but all who seek true education in the great school of life.",

Justification is wholly of grace and not procured by any works that fallen man can do. . . . Any works that man can render to God will be far less than nothingness.”<br/>This volume portrays a God of grace who embraces every sinful, struggling soul who accepts His offer of righteousness by faith",

She vividly recalls the sorrows and joys of youthful ministry in the years following the Great Disappointment. She pictures the struggles and successes that attended the efforts of the small band of earnest souls who built up the work that would eventually become the Seventh-day Adventist Church. She goes on to tell of the extended labors of herself and her husband from their marriage until his death in 1881.",

She examines those fundamental traits of character that make for success or failure in the spiritual life, and discusses practical subjects such as home and parents, health, courtship and marriage, and how to recognize true love.<br/>This bracing challenge to honor God with a self-controlled life will inspire many to join the army of dedicated youth who “climb the shining way,” who aim to “stand upon the summit of intellectual greatness” and serve their God.",

She describes the tragic rebellion that took place in heaven many thousands of years ago and makes plain  that this ongoing conflict between Satan and God affects each person who lives on Earth. <em>Patriarchs and Prophets</em> shows  how this conflict worked itself out in the lives of men and women in Old Testament times. It answers such questions  as: “Where did we come from?” “Where are we going?” and “If God is all-powerful, why doesn’t He prevent the  spread of evil and its tragic results?”",

        "description": "Temperance was a favorite theme of Ellen G. White, both in her writings and in her public speaking. Through the years, she urged everyone, both young and old, to practice temperance and to promote it vigorously. Although society has changed markedly since Mrs. White lived and wrote, the principles she stressed regarding temperance remain remarkably relevant to contemporary life. The power of alcohol and other forms of intemperance to destroy health, moral fiber, and spiritual discernment is still present today. The selections appearing in this book have been drawn from the whole range of her writings on the topic, including sources long out of print.",

Beginning with Lucifer’s rebellion in heaven and continuing to the work of angels after the end of sin, this volume provides a behind-the-scenes view of the existence and activities of angels as they go about the work of heaven. Best of all, it will help you enjoy the fellowship of angels in your daily walk with God.",

        "description": "“Looking unto Jesus, not only as our Example, but as the Author and Finisher of our faith, let us go forward, having confidence that He will supply us with all the strength that is needed for every duty.”<br/>Throughout her life Ellen G. White continually pointed to Jesus as our hope and salvation. Whether she was offering messages of reproof for errant believers or providing instruction for the faithful, her recurring theme was Christ—and Christ alone. In these excerpts from her letters and manuscripts, our thoughts are lifted heavenward as we are encouraged to “follow on step by step, with our eyes fixed upon our Leader.” Truly, we are capable of being genuine Christians only when our attention is focused on Christ.",

        "description": "Between the summers of 1971 and 1972, Pastor Dores A. Delafield and his wife, Evelyn, conducted seminar-type meetings with ministers, teachers, and laymen throughout Western and Eastern Europe. Often their journeys took them to towns and cities where Ellen White lived and labored between the years 1885 and 1887. <em>Ellen G. White in Europe</em> is the first serious attempt ever to put into print the record of those eventful years when Mrs. White labored so tirelessly on the European continent. Her influence was felt in the evangelistic and institutional expansion of Seventh-day Adventist witnessing in eight European countries. As a preacher and counselor she participated in  important conference sessions. She lectured in the major Adventist churches in Europe, meanwhile carrying forward a vast literary work, the influence of which is still felt around the world. Mrs. White appears in this volume not simply as a Christian laborer on the European scene, but as the Lord's special messenger, a warm, friendly human being yet conscientious and faithful in bearing her strong and inspired testimony for the Lord. The book opens an entirely new chapter in her lifework little known to the world and to the vast majority of Seventh-day Adventists. Her diary accounts of her European travels have been drawn from heavily as source material.",

To open a window of understanding to Ellen White’s heart, readers need to know and even experience her passions. There are two braided golden threads that weave through her entire life and experience that are central to who she was and what she accomplished—the love of God in Christ and a focus on Scripture. Her orientation toward the love of God and the Bible were integrally interwoven with her prophetic ministry. Her writings, which were guided by prophetic revelation through visions and prophetic dreams, must be read and understood with this perspective. ",

Dr. Coon responds to this question from the Bible, not by telling us whether God will ever send another prophet—but explaining how to recognize a true prophet and how to identify a fraud. He also tells the story of three people in the history of the church who claimed the prophetic gift but whose ministry did not match the guidelines set forth in Scripture.",

A notable change from the KJV is reference to God as “Jehovah ” instead of the traditional “Lord.”",

The Darby Bible’s official title reads, “A new translation from the original languages,” and its text reflects that with modernized language and spelling. Darby also published translations of the Bible in French and German.",

Após ser vencido por Cristo na cruz, Satanás, com grande ira, voltou sua atenção à igreja de Cristo na terra. Nesse livro você encontrará muitas emocionantes histórias de cruéis perseguições e da inabalável lealdade dos fiéis de Deus. Pedro, Paulo, Tiago, João, Lucas, Barnabé, Estevão, Marcos, e os outros apóstolos proclamaram as preciosas novas do Evangelho a todo o mundo então conhecido. Resolutos em não renunciar sua fé, muitos perderam sua vida. Mas a história ainda continua. A igreja de Cristo hoje está promovendo a mesma obra daquela época e ela têm a mesma promessa de direção e poder divinos de então.",

На нашем пути Бог насаждает цветы обетований, чтобы украсить ими нашу жизнь. Он устроил дорогу к небесам такой приятной. Когда мы изучаем Божьи обетования, то находим в них утешение, надежду и радость, потому что они являются Словами Безграничного”.</br>В этой книге собраны слова обетования и утешения для людей любого возраста и жизненной ситуации. Данные обетования, поддерживающие жизнь, особенно важны в эти последние дни земной истории, когда с большей силой разгорается великая борьба. Когда уже не на что опереться, мы все еще можем ухватиться за шнурки веры и найти убежище в заверении Божьего неизменного слова. ",

Будем помнить, что христоподобная жизнь служит самым убедительным свидетельством в пользу христианства, а профанация христианами своего призвания делает больше вреда, чем жизнь мирских людей. Не все книги могут послужить той же цели, которую в силах достичь благочестивая жизнь христиан. Люди поверят не тому, что проповедуется служителями церкви, а тому, какую жизнь ведут ее члены”.</br>Эта книга в основном является выдержкой из 9-го тома “Свидетельств для церкви”, и очень практически показывает нам, что такое христоподобная жизнь.
