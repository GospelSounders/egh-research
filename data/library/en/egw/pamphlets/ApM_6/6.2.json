We believe that too much importance cannot be attached to this subject, and that no false delicacy should prevent thorough inquiry and investigation upon a question in which the present and future welfare of multitudes is involved. As a people, who profess to be looking for the coming of the Lord, and preparing for translation into his holy presence, perhaps we have too long kept silent on this great source of physical, mental and moral pollution, and a high duty and responsibility remains to be discharged in this matter.</span>",

The flood-gates of corruption are being opened upon the world; and in no way, perhaps, is Satan more speedily accomplishing the <em>utter</em> ruin of a fallen and fast degenerating race than through the channel of unchastity and licentiousness. In the following pages the evil is fully pointed out: and to many, we doubt not, they will also appear as a friendly hand pointing out the remedy and the way of escape. Again we say, therefore, let the work be faithfully circulated. It would perhaps be well for every</span> <span class=\"page-break\" data-page=\"iv\"></span> <span class=\"non-egw-preface\">member of the family to possess a copy for his and her own personal possession. And remember that it will not be enough to merely place this work in the hands of the young. Cease not till you have good evidence that the moral sense of the individuals is so aroused, that they will study and faithfully heed the instruction herein contained.</span>",
