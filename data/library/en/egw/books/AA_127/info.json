  "description": "The amazing story of the early Christian believers is told in Volume 4, The Acts of the Apostles. After Jesus was victorious over Satan and returned to heaven, the enemy turned his attention to Jesus' church on earth. Here are thrilling stories of fierce persecutions and unswerving loyalty to God. Peter, Paul, James, John, Luke, Barnabas, Stephen, Mark, and the other early apostles carried the wonderful news of the gospel to all of the then-known world. Unwilling to surrender their faith, many gave their lives. That story is still continuing. Christ's church today is carrying forward the same work and has the same promise of divine guidance and power.<br/><b>NOTE: Pagination follows that of the standard printing which is also used in the Comprehensive (Topical) Index to the Writings of Ellen G. White.</b>",
