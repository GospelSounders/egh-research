I have seen much selfishness exhibited in these things. Unless there is some special <span class=\"page-break\" data-page=\"168\"></span> evidence that they <em>themselves</em> are to be benefited by adopting into their family those who need homes, some turn away and answer: No. They do not seem to know or care whether such are saved or lost.

With Cain they say: &ldquo;Am I my brother&apos;s keeper?&rdquo; They are not willing to be put to inconvenience or to make any sacrifice for the orphans, and they indifferently thrust such ones into the arms of the world, who are sometimes more willing to receive them than are these professed Christians. In the day of God inquiry will be made for those whom Heaven gave them the opportunity of saving. But they wished to be excused, and would not engage in the good work unless they could make it a matter of profit to them.

In place of giving so much attention to pets, lavishing affection upon dumb animals, let them exercise their talent upon human beings who have a heaven to win and a hell to shun. Let them give their attention to little children whose characters they may mold and fashion after the divine similitude. Place your love upon the homeless little ones that are around you.

    "content": "<strong>Should Ministers&rsquo; Wives Adopt Children?</strong>&mdash;The question has been asked whether a minister&apos;s wife should adopt infant children. I answer: if she has no inclination or fitness to engage in missionary work outside her home, and feels it her duty to take orphan children and care for them, she may do a good work. But let the choice of children be first made from among those who have been left orphans by Sabbathkeeping parents. God will bless men and women as they with willing hearts share their homes with these homeless ones. But if the minister&apos;s wife can herself act a part in the work of educating others, she should consecrate her powers to God as a Christian <span class=\"page-break\" data-page=\"170\"></span> worker. She should be a true helper to her husband, assisting him in his work, improving her intellect, and helping to give the message. The way is open for humble, consecrated women, dignified by the grace of Christ, to visit those in need of help and shed light into discouraged souls. They can lift up the bowed down by praying with them and pointing them to Christ. Such should not devote their time and strength to one helpless little mortal that requires constant care and attention. They should not thus voluntarily tie their hands.<sup class=\"chapterendnote\"><a class=\"chapterendnote\">5<span class=\"chapterendnote\"><span class=\"egwlink egwlink_book\" title=\"6T 285.2\" data-link=\"118.1540\">Ibid., 6:285</span>.</span></a></sup>",
