    "content": "Christian teachers and students are responsible to God for the gracious privileges they enjoy, for they are to be laborers together with God, bearing a decided testimony to the power of God&apos;s saving grace in the sight of earth and heaven. The efficiency and influence of the workers for God will be in proportion <span class=\"page-break\" data-page=\"82\"></span> to their moral elevation and purity. The true Christian teachers will discern the import of the Sabbath school lesson; for their understanding will be opened to comprehend the gospel. They will let their light shine to those who have taken no interest in the precious rays of truth. The door of the heart must be opened to receive the light shining from the Word. One Christian student who receives the word of God may be the means of blessing his fellow students. He can be a benefit to others if, patiently and kindly and interestingly, he will go over the lesson with those who do not take an interest in the things of God, and will make his instruction simple and definite. This kind of work will require the exercise of wisdom from above, that the worker may approach in an acceptable manner those who most need help, and lead them to Christ, where the wants of the soul may be satisfied....",
