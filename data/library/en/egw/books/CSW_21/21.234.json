If we merely read the Scriptures uninterestedly, we cannot become intelligent in the truths therein contained.",

But Jesus rebuked them, and said, &ldquo;Suffer the little children, and forbid them not, to come unto Me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.&rdquo; He then gathered them in His loving arms and blessed them. Those parents and teachers who have no love or patience with children are to be pitied, for they have not the mind of Christ. Those who are seeking to gather the children into the Sabbath school are doing a good work, the very work the Master would be pleased to have them do. The expanding minds of even small children may comprehend very much in regard to the teachings of Christ, and may be taught to love Him with all their ardent affections. Teachers and parents should sow beside all waters, and if faithful they may have a harvest of souls by and by. And when they shall see the souls for whom they have labored, around the great white throne, with crowns and white robes and harps of gold, they will feel then that their efforts were not lost. The well done, good and faithful servant, will fall upon their ears as sweet music.&mdash;<span class=\"egwlink egwlink_book\" title=\"ST 6-23-1881\" data-link=\"820.3512\"><em>The Signs of the Times</em>, June 23, 1881</span>.",
