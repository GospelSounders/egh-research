    "content": "Those who engage in Sabbath school work should be persons who have consecrated themselves to God. They should be men and women of strong faith and warm sympathies, who are fervent of spirit, and interested in all that pertains to the cause of Christ. They should give themselves to the work with unselfish endeavor, and at whatever sacrifice it may require, laying themselves on the altar, and pleading, with strong crying and tears, for the conversion of the youth who have been committed to their charge. Among those who would work for the Lord in the Sabbath school, let all selfish ambition be crucified, and &ldquo;let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.&rdquo; Let it be the Sabbath school worker&apos;s first ambition to educate the youth to do their duty in the fear of God and with simplicity.",

How greatly do the workers need a baptism of the Holy Spirit, that they may become true missionaries for God. They should learn to tax their minds to the utmost, that they may acquire a better knowledge of Bible truth. The teachers in the Sabbath school should pray daily for the enlightenment of heaven, that they may be able to open to the minds of the youth the treasures of the Sacred Word. Why not humble yourselves before the Lord, and let <span class=\"page-break\" data-page=\"156\"></span> the impression of the Holy Spirit be manifested upon your character and work? There is far too much self-complacency among those who engage in Sabbath school work, too much machinery and routine, and all this tends to lead the soul away from the Fountain of living water.&mdash;<span class=\"egwlink egwlink_book\" title=\"TSS 73.1\" data-link=\"121.292\"><em>Testimonies on Sabbath-School Work</em>, 73, 74</span>.",
