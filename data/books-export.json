      "description": "The amazing story of the early Christian believers is told in Volume 4, The Acts of the Apostles. After Jesus was victorious over Satan and returned to heaven, the enemy turned his attention to Jesus' church on earth. Here are thrilling stories of fierce persecutions and unswerving loyalty to God. Peter, Paul, James, John, Luke, Barnabas, Stephen, Mark, and the other early apostles carried the wonderful news of the gospel to all of the then-known world. Unwilling to surrender their faith, many gave their lives. That story is still continuing. Christ's church today is carrying forward the same work and has the same promise of divine guidance and power.<br/><b>NOTE: Pagination follows that of the standard printing which is also used in the Comprehensive (Topical) Index to the Writings of Ellen G.

No one else has had such a profound influence on Planet Earth as Jesus Christ. In this book the author does not set forth the events of Jesus’ life in strict chronological order, but she presents Him as the One who can satisfy the deepest yearnings of the human heart. She presents the divine beauty of the life of the Savior, the love of God as revealed in His Son. New and glorious light flashes from many familiar passages of Scripture. Follow Jesus in these pages from His birth in Bethlehem’s stable to His death on the cross, His glorious resurrection, and triumphant return to heaven.<br/><b>NOTE: Pagination follows that of the standard printing which is also used in the Comprehensive (Topical) Index to the Writings of Ellen G.

      "description": "The love and character of God has been put in question since the fall of Lucifer, who has spent millennia warring against the Lord and His faithful subjects. In this condensed version of The Great Controversy, the conflict is shown in the history of the first martyrs, the persecution of the Dark Ages, the subtle attacks in our “enlightened time,” and through prophetic views of the great final battle. Scripture declares that God's people will be victorious “by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.” In their every act, word, and thought, they will express their faith and assurance that “God is Love.”",

She pictures the struggles and successes that attended the efforts of the small band of earnest souls who built up the work that would eventually become the Seventh-day Adventist Church.

She examines those fundamental traits of character that make for success or failure in the spiritual life, and discusses practical subjects such as home and parents, health, courtship and marriage, and how to recognize true love.<br/>This bracing challenge to honor God with a self-controlled life will inspire many to join the army of dedicated youth who “climb the shining way,” who aim to “stand upon the summit of intellectual greatness” and serve their God.",

It answers such questions  as: “Where did we come from?” “Where are we going?” and “If God is all-powerful, why doesn’t He prevent the  spread of evil and its tragic results?”",

      "description": "Temperance was a favorite theme of Ellen G. White, both in her writings and in her public speaking. Through the years, she urged everyone, both young and old, to practice temperance and to promote it vigorously. Although society has changed markedly since Mrs. White lived and wrote, the principles she stressed regarding temperance remain remarkably relevant to contemporary life. The power of alcohol and other forms of intemperance to destroy health, moral fiber, and spiritual discernment is still present today. The selections appearing in this book have been drawn from the whole range of her writings on the topic, including sources long out of print.",

Beginning with Lucifer’s rebellion in heaven and continuing to the work of angels after the end of sin, this volume provides a behind-the-scenes view of the existence and activities of angels as they go about the work of heaven. Best of all, it will help you enjoy the fellowship of angels in your daily walk with God.",

      "description": "Between the summers of 1971 and 1972, Pastor Dores A. Delafield and his wife, Evelyn, conducted seminar-type meetings with ministers, teachers, and laymen throughout Western and Eastern Europe. Often their journeys took them to towns and cities where Ellen White lived and labored between the years 1885 and 1887. <em>Ellen G. White in Europe</em> is the first serious attempt ever to put into print the record of those eventful years when Mrs. White labored so tirelessly on the European continent. Her influence was felt in the evangelistic and institutional expansion of Seventh-day Adventist witnessing in eight European countries. As a preacher and counselor she participated in  important conference sessions. She lectured in the major Adventist churches in Europe, meanwhile carrying forward a vast literary work, the influence of which is still felt around the world. Mrs. White appears in this volume not simply as a Christian laborer on the European scene, but as the Lord's special messenger, a warm, friendly human being yet conscientious and faithful in bearing her strong and inspired testimony for the Lord. The book opens an entirely new chapter in her lifework little known to the world and to the vast majority of Seventh-day Adventists. Her diary accounts of her European travels have been drawn from heavily as source material.",

The last years of James White’s life were marked by notable achievements in building the church and its institutions in spite of periods impaired by illness. His rather sudden death at the age of 60 shocked both Ellen White and the church.",

To open a window of understanding to Ellen White’s heart, readers need to know and even experience her passions. There are two braided golden threads that weave through her entire life and experience that are central to who she was and what she accomplished—the love of God in Christ and a focus on Scripture. Her orientation toward the love of God and the Bible were integrally interwoven with her prophetic ministry. Her writings, which were guided by prophetic revelation through visions and prophetic dreams, must be read and understood with this perspective. ",

This question was increasingly being raised as Ellen White’s life drew to a close, and some people still wonder. Dr. Coon responds to this question from the Bible, not by telling us whether God will ever send another prophet—but explaining how to recognize a true prophet and how to identify a fraud. He also tells the story of three people in the history of the church who claimed the prophetic gift but whose ministry did not match the guidelines set forth in Scripture.",

Originally published in 1862, the most recent revision was made in 1898, after Young's death.",

Após ser vencido por Cristo na cruz, Satanás, com grande ira, voltou sua atenção à igreja de Cristo na terra. Nesse livro você encontrará muitas emocionantes histórias de cruéis perseguições e da inabalável lealdade dos fiéis de Deus. Pedro, Paulo, Tiago, João, Lucas, Barnabé, Estevão, Marcos, e os outros apóstolos proclamaram as preciosas novas do Evangelho a todo o mundo então conhecido. Resolutos em não renunciar sua fé, muitos perderam sua vida. Mas a história ainda continua. A igreja de Cristo hoje está promovendo a mesma obra daquela época e ela têm a mesma promessa de direção e poder divinos de então.",

На нашем пути Бог насаждает цветы обетований, чтобы украсить ими нашу жизнь. Он устроил дорогу к небесам такой приятной. Когда мы изучаем Божьи обетования, то находим в них утешение, надежду и радость, потому что они являются Словами Безграничного”.</br>В этой книге собраны слова обетования и утешения для людей любого возраста и жизненной ситуации. Данные обетования, поддерживающие жизнь, особенно важны в эти последние дни земной истории, когда с большей силой разгорается великая борьба. Когда уже не на что опереться, мы все еще можем ухватиться за шнурки веры и найти убежище в заверении Божьего неизменного слова. ",

Будем помнить, что христоподобная жизнь служит самым убедительным свидетельством в пользу христианства, а профанация христианами своего призвания делает больше вреда, чем жизнь мирских людей. Не все книги могут послужить той же цели, которую в силах достичь благочестивая жизнь христиан. Люди поверят не тому, что проповедуется служителями церкви, а тому, какую жизнь ведут ее члены”.</br>Эта книга в основном является выдержкой из 9-го тома “Свидетельств для церкви”, и очень практически показывает нам, что такое христоподобная жизнь.
